## Usage


## <a id="explanation"></a> Basic Explanation

The provided code is a C++ program that simulates the pouring of a liquid from one container to another. Two containers used in cell culture processes were used. 
For each container, there is a seperate scene header file, which defines the classes named 'Pouring_Flask' and 'Pouring_Bottle', which inherit from a base class called Scene.
These classes contain member variables and functions for simulating the pouring process. The 'Initialize' function initializes the simulation by creating the pouring and receiving containers, setting fluid parameters, and creating an emitter for the fluid particles. The 'Update' function is called every frame to update the simulation. The 'InPouringContainer' and 'InReceivingFlask' functions check if a particle is inside the pouring or receiving container, respectively. The results of each scene (TCP positions, parameters, and volume vs. theta) are saved in seperate text files.

In the main file, the general simulation specifications are defined. Additionally, the code generates multiple pouring scenes with different parameters for flasks and bottles, as well as a calibration scene, and stores them in the g_scenes vector. The counts of flask and bottle scenes are printed at the end. The varied parameters are the starting volume in the pouring container, the maximum angle of the pouring, and the duration of the waiting time at the maximum angle. The rotation speed stays constant.
