# Cell Culture Automation: System Prototype

The aim was to integrate existing laboratory hardware for a **proof-of-concept prototype of an autonomous cell culture system**.

The proposed system includes a UR5e collaborative industrial robot with an Intel RealSense D415 camera, a standard incubator that is adapted for automated opening and closing, a microscope, a unit for heating and cooling of liquids, and a capping and decapping unit. All the additional parts are 3D-printed or custom-built. The entire system is made to fit on one table. The robot arm executes the tasks usually done by human labor. The laboratory technician is only responsible for providing empty input flasks and refilling the required liquids. 

## Hardware Setup

An overview of the hardware setup can be seen here:

(1) Automated incubator. (2) Microscope. (3) Trypsin unit. (4) Capper/Decapper. (5) Lid holders. (6) Flask storage. (7) Flask holder for pouring. (8) UR5e with 3D-printed gripper fingers. (9) Heating and Cooling of Liquids Unit.

The following external equipment is needed. The rest of the elements can be 3D printed using the files in the `CAD` folder.
